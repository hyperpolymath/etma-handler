can you change this to a README adoc and make it utter best practice - the credit to Mike and minimisation of my role, and the highlighting mine is not official and currently has data integrity issues is important here # OU eTMA File Handler

Original design by Mike Hayes, available at https://www.hayfamily.co.uk/etmahandlerpage.html
Mike's is the production edition and official-unofficial eTMA by the University.

This is a work-in-progress. It does not involve any substantive code alteration (yet I still broke it :/).
There are problems with the the handling of data that leads to corruption of data at this time., that does not occur (to my knowledge) in the original

The chanages I have made here -

a) rearranging the directory structure to declutter the root, and separate out users and developers
b) replacement of the following components
  i) Virtual Machine with Temurin 25 with 32/64 support and asdf updating
  ii) 
  iii)
  iv)
  v)
c) switching to cross-platform scripting. The original used dedicated scripts meaning separate versions were required
d) support for 32/64bit processors
e) extended accessibility support (latest accessible pdf format, braille, high contrast text,...
f) a single entry script with menu that allows for install, running in site as portable, check for and (and optional install)

Though this probably sounds like a lot of changes, most of these are opportunities are created simply in replacement of old components with different ones (newer standards, extended functionality), e.g.

a) PDFs have seen immense pressure to improve accessibility
b) adoc support for documentation is near universal
c) 

It is simply to remove the older VM and dependencies and replace with more up-to-date technologies.

It MUST NOT be used for actual assignment handling at this time - comments, however, for its development are much welcomed.

## Quick Start

**Double-click to run:**
```
./etmaHandler.sh
```

## What's What

| File/Folder | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `etmaHandler.sh` | **Main launcher** - run this |
| `install.sh` | Creates desktop shortcut |
| `browser-auth-workaround.sh` | Use if login fails (opens browser first) |
| `modernized/` | Updated Java 25 + Jakarta EE version |
| `dist/` | Legacy version (old Java) |
| `etmaDictionary.dic` | Spell checker dictionary |

## Troubleshooting

### "Login failed" or SAML errors
Run `./browser-auth-workaround.sh` - this opens the browser to authenticate first, then launches the app.

### Java not found
Ensure Java is installed. The handler uses:
1. asdf-managed Temurin 25 (preferred)
2. Bundled JRE in `dist/jre/` (fallback)

### Window doesn't appear
Check if already running: `pgrep -f etmaHandler`
